    "The presence of offensive content being recommended by the system is a problem, whether that be religiously offensive, culturally offensive, or something else entirely. There are two main sides to this issue. The users of the recommendation system should not have to see offensive items being recommended to them when they are using a specific system. From a business perspective, this issue will likely cause customers to quit using the product and move onto other alternatives, ultimately causing the company some loss in profits. This ethical issue is unique in the sense that both sides want to avoid this issue. Customers do not want offensive content recommended and companies do not want their customers to have a poor experience that might cause them to seek out other products. "

    "However, the issue comes when trying to solve this universally accepted ethical dilemma with recommendation systems. The typical solution to this problem is that the company collects a significant amount of personal information about its customers to be able to curate their experience enough to avoid any offensive content being recommended. However, this leads to another ethical problem with these systems, privacy.  This collection of information, usually without explicit consent from the customers, is a very serious violation of privacy rights. This breach of privacy without proper consent is very dangerous, especially with the possibility of data leaks. Customers receive a benefit from a recommendation system that better understands them, but they also should be able to better control how their data is collected and processed. "

    "This discussion of privacy leads to another connected ethical concern with recommender systems, bias. When this amount of data is collected and processed, it can lead to biases and stereotypes being enforced within the recommendations themselves. A specific type of bias with recommendation systems discussed by the paper by Milano, Taddeo, and Floridi is news feeds. They discuss how the recommendations fed to the consumers can create a self-sustaining feedback loop. For example, a user that is relatively in the center politically can begin to get recommended conservative articles. After a long period of time, this could lead to the recommendation system altering this person’s personal beliefs. The loop becomes a feedback loop because as the user becomes more conservative, the system is increasingly encouraged to recommend conservative articles. This is especially true with the content recommendation of Facebook. According to an NPR article, “one out of five users experience an echo chamber on the platform, where at least three-quarters of the posts they see come from ideologically aligned sources” (NPR). This problem with bias becomes such a big issue when recommendation systems are allowed to run rampant without human intervention. "

These ethical issues need to be seriously considered and addressed for the sake of our society. There have already been many negative events created or enforced by the presence of big data.
